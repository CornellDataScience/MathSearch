# MathSearch

A next generation search engine for researchers that supports searching for equations inside PDFs with LaTeX math script. To learn more about our machine learning and data pipeline, refer to our [wiki](https://github.com/CornellDataScience/MathSearch/wiki). Our domain (mathsearch.org) is not currently active, but please check back here for updates in the near future!

## Features
- LaTeX Math Script Support: Search using LaTeX, the standard for mathematical typesetting, or use our virtual keyboard.
- Research Focused: Tailored to meet the needs of academic and scientific researchers.
- Advanced Search Capabilities: Improved search accuracy for mathematical queries.
